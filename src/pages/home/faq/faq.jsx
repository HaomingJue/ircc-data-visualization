          This system is mainly used for immigration statistics. 
          The goal is for the IRCC to get information about people with migration motives so
           that the government can introduce relevant policies for immigration. In addition to the
            data collection, the system also emphasizes data visualization and data analysis, 
            which will help to simplify reports by using charts, tables, and dashboards.
